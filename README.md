# Netflix Clone ðŸŽ¬

This is my first major front-end project: a clone of the Netflix homepage, built entirely with **HTML** and **CSS**.
The goal was to replicate the look and feel of the Netflix landing page as closely as possible,
focusing on the layout design.

This project was a fantastic learning experience where I practiced:

* **Semantic HTML5:** Structuring the website for clarity and accessibility.
* **Advanced CSS:** Using **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** to create complex, responsive layouts.
